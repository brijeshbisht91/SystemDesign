In this video, we're going to reveal about Kafka used in System Design:
- Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used for publish and subscribe to streams of records. 
 - Kafka is fast and uses IO efficiently by batching and compressing records. Kafka is used for decoupling data streams. Kafka is used to stream 
 data into data lakes, applications, and real-time stream analytics systems.
 - Kafka clusters retain all published record. If you donâ€™t set a limit, it will keep records until it runs out of disk space.
 - Kafka Is Scalable Message Storage
 - Why kafka is fast: Kafka enables you to batch data records into chunks. These batches of data can be seen end-to-end from producer 
 to file system (Kafka topic log) to the consumer. Batching allows for more efficient data compression and reduces I/O latency. 
 
 - Producer: 
  - It send data, message, file
 - Consumer: 
  - It receive data
  - Producer just send the data to kafka server & any consumer can subscribe from kafka server. Consumer keeps on requesting data from server.
 - Broker:
  - Producer & consumer interact through Broker or kafa server
 - Cluster:
  - Kafka is distributed system, so cluster have many brokers
 - Topic: 
  - It's for identification for uniquely identify stream.
  - i.e we created Global Orders topic is created, Now consumer can subcribe to this topic
 - Partition: 
  - Break Kakfa topic to multiple partition & store one partition on one cumputer
  - It's upon us to decide how many partition can be there. 
 - Offset: 
  - It's sequence id given to message as they arrive in partition
  - Topic name - Partition Number - Offset can locate exact message
 - Consumer Group:
  - Group of consumer who share the same workaround
  - It's for scalibility
