Consistent Hashing:
 - If you have 'K mod n' way hashing, adding a new server can have all hashing need to do from starting
 - But in consitent hashing we need to map only k/n again, where k = number of keys & n is cache servers
 - Whenever you add new cache server, it'll fetch some of existing servers keys, which lie inside it.
 - When you remove any nodes, next node handles all it's keys, so we need to map only deleted node's key.
